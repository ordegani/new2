      ArtNotes was made for working people who want to find their passion in the
      big universe of art history.
      <br />
      It is a tool that makes organizing and exploring art history as quick as
      possible. <br />
      Art history does not belong to the academy alone ❦<br />
      <br />
      Art Notes are little notes you can save for later - when you have the time
      to "dive" deeper. It is very simple and quick to use - you can use it on
      your way to work, while doing house chores etc. You don't have to be an
      art student or pay for expensive museums programmes. Just browse images
      and create notes for later ❦<br />
      <br />
      1. Go to the "Discover" page and get one of our personal favourite
      artist's work history (randomized). Browse his or she's work and save what
      interested you on the "create Note" page: your personal inputs and/or
      educational relavant links for later, and the art work's details. come
      back to the list of all art works you saved whenever you need inspiration,
      or when you have the proper time to read further.
      <br />
      2. If you already know what artist interests you - write her or his name
      in the search form on the "Search" page, and browse through their work. If
      you wish you can, of course, create new notes and save them to your list
      from there as well.
      <br />
      We advice you to add a spotify/goodread list in the personal notes section
      of every saved art work on your list, and share it ❦
